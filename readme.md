   - Added license-specific quota checking
   - Improved warnings for mailboxes approaching quota limits

3. **New-MailboxTestResult.ps1**
   - Added new properties for all additional validation scenarios
   - Expanded property definitions to support enhanced validation

4. **Test-EXOMailboxReadiness.ps1**
   - Updated to include all new validation functions

   - Validates the current mailbox is not in a soft-deleted state

6. **Test-AliasConflicts.ps1**
   - Detects alias and email address conflicts in the target environment
   - Identifies potential conflicts that would prevent migration

7. **Test-JournalConfiguration.ps1**
   - Checks if the mailbox is part of journaling rules
   - Identifies if the mailbox is a journal recipient

8. **Test-NamespaceConflicts.ps1**
   - Validates that the mailbox's domains are properly verified
   - Detects shared namespace issues that could affect mail flow

9. **Test-FolderNameConflicts.ps1**

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Advanced License-Based Quota Checking**
   - License-specific mailbox quotas (E1: 50GB, E3/E5: 100GB)
   - Secondary threshold for "large but within quota" mailboxes
   - Improved warnings for mailboxes approaching quota limits

2. **Azure AD Sync Validation**
   - Verifies mailbox is properly synchronized between on-premises and Azure AD
   - Checks for DirSync status, immutableId, and synchronization time
   - Validates that the object exists in both environments

   - Cloud mailbox placeholder identification
   - Alias and email address conflict resolution
   - Namespace conflict detection

4. **Compliance and Special Configuration Awareness**
   - Audit log configuration preservation
   - Journaling rule detection
   - Recoverable Items size analysis
   - Archive mailbox validation

5. **Performance and User Experience Optimization**
   - Item age distribution analysis
   - Mailbox activity level assessment
   - Folder permission depth analysis
   - Folder name conflict detection

## Configuration Options

- `NearQuotaPercentageThreshold`: Percentage of quota to trigger "approaching limit" warnings (default: 80)
- `CheckForAuditLogConfiguration`: Enable/disable audit log configuration check
- `CheckRecoverableItemsSize`: Enable/disable recoverable items size check
- `RecoverableItemsSizeThresholdGB`: Threshold for recoverable items size warnings (default: 15)
- `MaxFolderLimit`: Maximum recommended folder count (default: 10,000)
- `MaxItemsPerFolderLimit`: Maximum recommended items per folder (default: 100,000)
- `CheckForSoftDeletedItems`: Enable/disable soft-deleted items check
- `CheckFolderNameConflicts`: Enable/disable folder name conflict check
- `CheckNamespaceConflicts`: Enable/disable namespace conflict check

## Usage Example

```powershell
# Run basic validation
Test-EXOMailboxReadiness -EmailAddress "user@contoso.com" -ValidationLevel Basic

# Run comprehensive validation
